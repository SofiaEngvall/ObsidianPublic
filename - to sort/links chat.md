Tomáš Růžička 05:11 PM  
Is there some difference between ethical hacker and security expert, or are those names for the same thing ?
Vandana Verma Sehgal | SNYK 05:31 PM 
Ethical Hacker: An ethical hacker, also known as a white-hat hacker or penetration tester, is an individual who uses hacking techniques to identify and uncover vulnerabilities and weaknesses in computer systems, networks, or applications. They are typically hired by organizations to assess the security of their systems, simulate real-world attacks, and provide recommendations for improving their security defenses. Ethical hackers often focus on specific tasks such as penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, or red teaming.

Security Expert: A security expert, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses professionals with expertise in various aspects of cybersecurity. Security experts may have diverse roles, including security analysts, security architects, incident responders, security consultants, or security managers. They are responsible for designing, implementing, and managing security measures to protect systems, networks, and data. Their expertise extends beyond hacking techniques to encompass risk management, compliance, security policies, and incident response.

How XSF is different from XSS ? I forgot it in time...
Vandana Verma Sehgal | SNYK 05:41 PM 
Cross-Site Forgery, also known as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), is an attack that tricks a victim into performing an unwanted action on a web application in which they are authenticated. The attack occurs when an attacker tricks the victim into clicking on a specially crafted link or visiting a malicious website that triggers a request on the victim's behalf without their knowledge or consent. This attack takes advantage of the victim's existing session or authentication credentials.

For example, let's say a victim is logged into their online banking account. The attacker could create a malicious website or send the victim an email with a deceptive link. If the victim clicks on the link while logged into their banking account, the attacker's webpage or script could initiate a transaction (e.g., transferring funds) without the victim's awareness or consent.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Cross-Site Scripting, or XSS, is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a website viewed by other users. It occurs when a website doesn't properly validate or sanitize user-provided input, and the attacker is able to insert their own script code into the page. When other users access the affected page, their web browsers execute the injected script code, leading to various harmful consequences.
