: ah the documentation is for the "main" branch. i changed the project structur for the dev branch. in the dev branch you only gotta git clone and type "make" to build everything

C5pider
: everything is controled over the "havoc" binary. starting the server over "havoc server ..." and starting the client over "havoc client"

C5pider
: the documentation for dev is on a website: https://havocframework.com/
