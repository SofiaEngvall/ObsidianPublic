## Dragon's Fury Simulation

In the epic battle against Malakar's dark forces, the ancient dragons must unleash a series of precise attacks. Each attack round offers several potential damage valuesâ€”but only one combination of attacks will sum up exactly to the damage required to vanquish the enemy.

### Your Task

1. Read a single string that represents a list of subarrays. Each subarray contains possible damage values for one round.  
    Example: `[[13, 15, 27, 17], [24, 15, 28, 6, 15, 16], [7, 25, 10, 14, 11], [23, 30, 14, 10]]`
2. Read an integer T that represents the target total damage required.
3. Pick exactly one number from each subarray so that their sum equals T.  
    It is guaranteed that there is exactly one valid solution.
4. Output the valid combination (as a list) that meets the target damage.

## Example

### Input

[[13, 15, 27, 17], [24, 15, 28, 6, 15, 16], [7, 25, 10, 14, 11], [23, 30, 14, 10]]
77

### Output

[13, 24, 10, 30] 

Explanation:

The input represents 4 rounds of attacks, each with a list of possible damage values. The unique valid solution is the combination `[13, 24, 10, 30]` which sums exactly to 77.

```python
#input
attack_info = list(input().split("], ["))
attacks = []
for i in range(len(attack_info)):
    attacks.append(list(map(int,attack_info[i].strip("[]").split(","))))
correct_sum = int(input())
#print(attacks)

#if we print a list it will be the right format so we don't have to make the string :)
def add_recurse(attacks, i, values):
    if i == len(attacks):
        if sum(values) == correct_sum:
            print(values)
        return
    for value in attacks[i]:
        add_recurse(attacks, i+1, values + [value]) #+ value instead of append created a new list

add_recurse(attacks, 0, [])

```
