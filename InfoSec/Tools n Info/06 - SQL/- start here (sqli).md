think of what the sql query might be, maybe `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND password := password`


`' OR 1=1 -- -`    obs, not safe as all rows are returned/possibly updated
	`'` to end the current string
	`1=1` to have a always true statement
	`--` starta a comment (but requires a space and a random character efter giving `-- -`)
