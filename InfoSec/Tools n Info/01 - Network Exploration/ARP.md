Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is responsible for finding the MAC (hardware) address related to a specific IP address. It works by broadcasting an ARP query, "Who has this IP address? Tell me." And the response is of the form, "The IP address is at this MAC address."

ARP has one purpose: sending a frame to the broadcast address on the network segment and asking the computer with a specific IP address to respond by providing its MAC (hardware) address.
