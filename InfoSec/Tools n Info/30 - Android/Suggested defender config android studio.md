The IDE has detected Microsoft Defender with Real-Time Protection enabled. It might severely degrade IDE performance. It is recommended to make sure the following paths are added to the Defender folder exclusion list:  

C:\Users\sofia\.gradle
C:\Users\sofia\AndroidStudioProjects\Test
C:\Users\sofia\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
C:\Users\sofia\AppData\Local\Google\AndroidStudio2024.1

If you previously excluded them either automatically or manually, please select "Ignore for this project". Note: running "Automatically" will ask for administrative privileges.
