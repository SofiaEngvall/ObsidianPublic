### md5sum --help
```sh
Usage: md5sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Print or check MD5 (128-bit) checksums.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
  -b, --binary          read in binary mode
  -c, --check           read checksums from the FILEs and check them
      --tag             create a BSD-style checksum
  -t, --text            read in text mode (default)
  -z, --zero            end each output line with NUL, not newline,
                          and disable file name escaping

The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
      --ignore-missing  don´t fail or report status for missing files
      --quiet           don´t print OK for each successfully verified file
      --status          don´t output anything, status code shows success
      --strict          exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
  -w, --warn            warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

      --help        display this help and exit
      --version     output version information and exit

The sums are computed as described in RFC 1321.
When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.
The default mode is to print a line with: checksum, a space,
a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary, ' ' for text
or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.

Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on GNU systems.
