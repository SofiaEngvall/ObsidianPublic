CUPP is an automatic and interactive tool written in Python for creating custom wordlists. For instance, if you know some details about a specific target, such as their birthdate, pet name, company name, etc., this could be a helpful tool to generate passwords based on this known information. CUPP will take the information supplied and generate a custom wordlist based on what's provided. There's also support for a 1337/leet mode, which substitutes the letters a, i,e, t, o, s, g, z  with numbers. For example, replace a  with 4  or i with 1.
