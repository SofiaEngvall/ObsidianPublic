It's sometimes possible to find passwords for running services in the registry. VNC servers, for example, frequently leave passwords in the registry stored in plaintext. Some versions of the FileZilla FTP server also leave credentials in an XML file at `C:\Program Files\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml`  
Â or `C:\xampp\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml`  
. These can be MD5 hashes or in plaintext, depending on the version.
