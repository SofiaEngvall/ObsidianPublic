when OpenSSH is installed and running, the SSH keys are typically stored in the `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh` directory
`%USERPROFILE%` is usually `C:\Users\username`

Inside this directory, you'll usually find files such as `id_rsa` (private key), `id_rsa.pub` (public key), and `known_hosts` (list of known hosts).
