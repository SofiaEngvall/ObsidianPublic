What is a recovery?

The recovery is what starts on your phone when you press a special combination of buttons on your phone. You might have used it to reinstall your phone to the way it was when it was new. You might also have noticed that the recovery is often updated when your phone is. When you reset the phone later in it's life what you get when reinstalling is no longer what the phone contained the first time you started it.

This means two things!
1. This data can be updated. We can modify it as well as samsungs own updates.
2. We can load bad data here and destroy out ability to reset the phone.
