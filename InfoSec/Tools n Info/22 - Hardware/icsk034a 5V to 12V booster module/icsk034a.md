The kit has a 1kohm resistor instead of an 1ohm resistor. We tried putting the lowest value I had, a 10ohm on the board instead, no success.

Plan: build it on a breadboard instead - I'm sure we'll learn stuff


5V to 12V booster module using MC34063

"This circuit mainly include filter capacitance, booster chip MC34063 and resistance, lose Into the voltage through the filter capacitor, link to booster chip MC34063, MC34063 the input voltage booster to the 12V output, after electrolytic capacitor filter, stable output of 12V voltage."
