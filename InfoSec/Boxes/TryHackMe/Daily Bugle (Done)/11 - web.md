We can now log in as admin using
user: jonah
pass: spiderman123

Googling joomla admin to shell we found:
https://www.hackingarticles.in/joomla-reverse-shell/

The guide told us to Click Extensions - Templates - Templates
Click One of the templates and then one of the php files, like index.php.

Just paste your rev shell and click preview (after starting nc of course)
