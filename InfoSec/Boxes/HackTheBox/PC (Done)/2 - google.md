googled for "port 50051"

found hits saying it's gRPC
[ex link](https://documentation.softwareag.com/webmethods/compendiums/v10-11/C_API_Management/index.html#page/api-mgmt-comp/to-grpc_configuration_7.html)

googled for "grpc exploit" and similar but found nothing

garr knew about a tool called grpcui so I googled that
