Test: Seem to be optimized to read with your eyes. Can't TTS PDFs.

Test: No dark mode? Reads TTS ok for the tested epub and pdf. Files seem to be "uploaded" and there's no trace of what you have read. This is more for pasting chunks of text to read. Huge font and even more huge "subtitles". For people with bad vision? I think you can see your "uploaded" docs if logging in = definitely not an option!

If I select a text in acrobat reader and press the play button of the app it reads it. Tryed to make it read this text too. Worked fine. I'm looking for a windows replacement for @Voice for android though. I expect the app to be able to keep files locally, remember where I was reading...
