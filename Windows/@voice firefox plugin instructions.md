About this extension

Companion desktop browser extension for @Voice Aloud Reader app for Android. When you see any interesting page in your desktop browser, simply click the @Voice extension icon and it will be added to @Voice reading list. Later read or listen to a list of saved articles as you commute, jog, walk, do household chores etc.  
  
The articles are synced through your Google Drive storage "@Voice" folder. Synced articles which you remove in @Voice app from your reading list, are automatically trashed in Google Drive, and if you actually delete the article files on your Android device, the trashed files are permanently removed too.

Works very well - it's just that it doesn't tell you anywhere I can find what the instructions are, so I'll give them here:  
  
- install "@Voice sync plugin" from google play to allow signing in to your google drive  
  
- create manually a folder name "@Voice" in your main google drive  
  
then you just click on the plugin button and it'll come up with a little notification saying "Added [web page title]" and you can go to your default reading list, tap the three dots, and select "add from google drive". It'll add whatever pages you added using this add-on automatically.  
  
Otherwise so far it seems to work perfectly; removed one star for having no instructions in the main info or really anywhere easy to find (I stumbled across this in a review for the chrome version of this add on plus some messing around).
