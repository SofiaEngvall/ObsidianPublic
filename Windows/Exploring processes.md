The System process always has the ID 4
Runs in kernel mode

In windows, the processor has two modes, kernel mode for the system/core OS components and user mode for the apps. This affects which address space is uses. A user mode process can't access virtual addresses reserved for the OS.

All code running in kernel mode shares a single virtual address space.


#### smss.exe - Session Manager Subsystem/Windows Session Manager
*parent: System (4)*

first user-mode process started by the kernel
starts the kernel and user modes, includes:
- win32k.sys (kernel mode)
- winsrv.dll (user mode)
- csrss.exe (user mode)

###### Sessions (User mode?)

Session 0
- an isolated Windows session for the operating system
- csrss.exe (Client Server Runtime Process - Windows subsystem) and wininit.exe (Windows Start-Up Application)

Session 1
- the user session
- csrss.exe (as above) and winlogon.exe (Windows Logon Process)

Also starts subsystems in `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Subsystems` set as `Required`.
