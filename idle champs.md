Champions: according to the picture
Specializations: according to the picture
Familiars: familiars on champs and three on the field
Feats: Start with no damage feats. Use feats and nodes to dial in how many stacks you gain

Core: Fast core, no damage nodes - We can load from: https://ic.byteglow.com/modron, Layout Library, Fast Core, click the folder icon above "Gem Farm (No Damage)"

Favor: stay away from favor ending in xx3 or xx8 since Thellora skips levels based on favor. The first hop will be Thelloras and Brivs skips together.

Potions: Use 1large+1med+if needed 1 small potion

Briv stacking before start: I go into a variant in avernus "troublesome prisoner" sit briv next to the npc and he does no damage, and wont advance, then swap parties and wait a moment and go back, or close the game, wait a moment, and come back and you will have a ton of steelbones stacks. level briv up as much as you can without killing the 25 to advance or it seems to throw it off

to grab loot, set stop zone past stacking
