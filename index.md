Here you can find my notes on cyber security and other interesting stuff :)

Some pages to check out:

[[Tools n Info/Index|Cyber Secutity Tools & Info]]
...

Please use the search or the menu to find what you're looking for! :)

These notes are also available in a more updated (but less readable online) version on github: https://github.com/SofiaEngvall/ObsidianPublic

Obsidian is the great and free notes taking tool I use.
