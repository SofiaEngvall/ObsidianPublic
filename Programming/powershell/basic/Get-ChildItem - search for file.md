DESCRIPTION
    The Get-ChildItem cmdlet gets the items in one or more specified locations. If the item is a container, it gets the items inside the container, known as child items.
    You can use the Recurse parameter to get items in all child containers.

    A location can be a file system location, such as a directory, or a location exposed by a different Windows PowerShell provider, such as a registry hive or a
    certificate store.
    In a file system drive, the Get-ChildItem cmdlet gets the directories, subdirectories, and files. In a file system directory, it gets subdirectories and files.

    By default, Get-ChildItem gets non-hidden items, but you can use the Directory, File, Hidden, ReadOnly, and System parameters to get only items with these
    attributes. To create a complex attribute search, use the Attributes parameter. If you use these parameters, Get-ChildItem gets only the items that meet all search
    conditions, as though the parameters were connected by an AND operator.

    Note: This custom cmdlet help file explains how the Get-ChildItem cmdlet works in a file system drive. For information about the Get-ChildItem cmdlet in all drives,
    type "Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Path $null" or see Get-ChildItem at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113308.
