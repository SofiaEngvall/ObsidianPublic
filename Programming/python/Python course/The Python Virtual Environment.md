First install `pypy3-venv`

Create a virtual environment in the directory: `python3 -m venv .`

Run `source bin/activate` to start using the environment

The venv will be used automatically for the user but to run a script with sudo you need to give the local python path: `./bin/python`

Run `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment

Use pip3 for installing libraries, it's aware of virtual environments
