### Base setup

Map: The Everlasting Rime (Icewind Dale, lowest town)

Formation:

If we don't use large speed potions we can add Shandie like:
![[Images/Pasted image 20250501134305.png]]

Specializations: according to the picture (arrows)

Familiars: familiars on champs and three on the field (not click damage) (if 5j-9j Briv, use 5 familiars)

Feats: Start with no damage feats. Use feats and nodes to dial in how many stacks you gain

Core: Fast core, no damage nodes - We can load from: https://ic.byteglow.com/modron, Layout Library, Fast Core, click the folder icon above "Gem Farm (No Damage)"

Favor: When you have a 4 jump Briv - Stay away from favor ending in xx3 or xx8 (or 5 to avoid barriers) since Thellora skips levels based on favor. The first hop will be Thelloras and Brivs skips together.

Potions: Use 1 small and 1 medium speed potion (1 large if you can afford it, then you might not need the small one) and 1 medium firebreath to set the familiats to champion bud damage

### Before you start

There are variants where champions in specific places don't deal damage. One is `Troublesome prisoner` in Avernus. You can place Briv next to the prisoner and he deals no damage. Level him up a few levels.

When you have placed Briv in a place where he's getting stacks, swap parties and wait a bit before you go back.

### Balancing a Briv Gem farming party

Start with Briv stacked a bit more than you think you'll need.

Make sure auto reset is off in you mordon.

Note down when Briv gets stacks and what numbers:

level 494 - 170 stacks
level 499 - 296 stacks
level 504 - 658 stacks
level 509 - 1474 stacks
level 514 - 2889 stacks

Now we go to https://ic.byteglow.com/speed and enter the levels into the calculator to see how many Briv stacks we need to keep him hopping all the way to these levels:

![[Images/Pasted image 20250501135700.png]]

Required stacks for Briv for different goal levels:

level 504 - 1304
level 509 - 1345
level 514 - 1392 <- Here we had enough to keep hopping through to the same spot if we had reset
level 519 - 1438 (to grab an extra bag o gems during a last jump we need this one)
level 524 - 1486

Take into account that this number will vary, more or less depending on your setup and random chance.

Now let's manually `Complete and Restart` the adventure We should have more than enough stacks!

Write down the stack levels again:

494 - 249
499 - 508
504 - 910
509 - 1606 <- This time we would have had enough already at 509 (over 1438)
514 - 2004

Let's reset again and check the numbers. How stable are they?

494 - 199
499 - 360
504 - 715
509 - 1558 <- 509 this time too (but we only had 658 the first run we wrote down)
514 - 3226

They're all so different but about at the same level

Let's set 515 (to grab the gems of the boss we would skip past) as the reset point and still check the numbers on the next one.

![[Images/Pasted image 20250501142140.png]]

504 763
509 1057
514 enough, over 2000

504 1444 for some reason this one went slower/we were weaker
509 3091
514 well, let's say it was enough when it restarted lol

504 503
509 849
514 1716 pooh, enough, the lowest one! - this shows using 509 to loop would not have worked here at least

Checking sometimes that it has stacks the whole way
514 2460
514 2975

514 seem to work for now. As long as there's no general boost of one of these characters power or similar.
