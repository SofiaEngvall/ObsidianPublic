| 1  | Mortal Kombat 11               | Its a rare fighting game that hits just about every note as strongly as Mortal Kombat 11 does. Everything from its methodical and deep combat.                                                         |
| 2  | Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3     | Switch owners will find plenty of content to chew through, particularly with friends, and while it may be the gaming equivalent to a Hulk Smash, that isnt to say that it isnt a rollicking good time. |

| 5  | Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 | When you look at the total package, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is hands-down one of the best first-person shooters out there, and a truly amazing offering across any system.                      |
