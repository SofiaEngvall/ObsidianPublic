our profile has $100

We can buy products, including the flag. But it's too expensive.

Let's look at the cookie we got. It contains the email and the balance

Let's purchase the most expensive item we can afford for $30
![[Images/Pasted image 20250425021816.png]]

Let's send this request to repeater and send it 30 times to use $900 lots of times (shift+space).

Since our balance is in the cookie it won't be reduced by a purchase when we use the same old cookie to send again.

We sell these and we'll get lots of money :)
