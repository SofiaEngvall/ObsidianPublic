## 2>&1

In Unix-like operating systems, file descriptors are used to manage input and output streams for processes. Here's what each part of `2>&1` does:

- `2`: This refers to file descriptor 2, which corresponds to the standard error (stderr) stream. Standard error is where error messages and diagnostics are typically sent in Unix-like systems.

- `>`: This symbol is used for redirection. It directs the output of the following command to a file or another file descriptor.

- `&1`: This is a bit of shorthand. The `&` here indicates that what follows is not a filename but rather another file descriptor. `1` refers to file descriptor 1, which corresponds to the standard output (stdout) stream. Combining `&1` essentially means "redirect file descriptor 2 to the same place as file descriptor 1."

So, `2>&1` means "redirect stderr (file descriptor 2) to the same location as stdout (file descriptor 1)." This is commonly used to ensure that both regular output and error messages are sent to the same destination when using redirection. In the context of the provided command, it ensures that any error messages produced by the shell are also sent to the FIFO along with regular output.
