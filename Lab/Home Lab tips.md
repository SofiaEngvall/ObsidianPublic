local machines, virtual machines and/or vpses online

What to do/set up:

-  Build an Active Directory forest for your house
- Run your own DNS from Active Directory
- Run your own DHCP server from Active Directory
- Have multiple zones in your network, including a DMZ if you’re going to serve services out of the house
- Graduate up to a real firewall as soon as possible. I recommend Sophos’ firewall (previously Astaro), as I’ve been using it since it came out, but there are other good iptables and pf options. Doing this will require you to learn about routing and NAT and all sorts of basics that are truly essential for progression.
- Stand up a website on Windows/IIS
- Stand up a website on Linux/PHP

- Build an OpenBSD box and create a DNS Server using DJBDNS
- Set up a proxy server
- Build and run your own VPN on a VPS
- Build and configure an email server that can send email to the Internet using Postfix, Qmail, or Sendmail (I recommend Postfix)
