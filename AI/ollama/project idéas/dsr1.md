To embark on a beginner-friendly project using Ollama and Python, follow these organized steps:

1. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Use pip to install necessary libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install ollama openai pandas
     ```

2. **Set Up Ollama Client**:
   - Import the `OllamaClient` class from `ollama`.
   - Initialize the client with a specific port (e.g., 11434) and timeout:
     ```python
     from ollama import OllamaClient

     client = OllamaClient(11434, 30)
     ```

3. **Select an Appropriate Model**:
   - Choose a model based on your needs; `gpt-35-turbo` is recommended for its power and versatility.

4. **Read Data from CSV**:
   - Utilize pandas to import data:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     df = pd.read_csv("my_data.csv")
     ```

5. **Prepare Inputs and Generate Outputs**:
   - Construct prompts or queries that include necessary information from your DataFrame.
   - For each row, create a prompt string incorporating the relevant data.

6. **Call the Model with Parameters**:
   - Use the client to invoke the model, passing in your prompt along with parameters like `temperature` and `max_tokens`.

7. **Handle Exceptions and Test Incrementally**:
   - Implement error handling around model calls.
   - Test each component (client setup, data import, model invocation) separately before integrating them.

By following these steps, you can effectively create a structured project that leverages Ollama for processing data from CSV files, enabling you to generate outputs based on dynamic prompts.
