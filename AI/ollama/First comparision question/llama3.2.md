JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The token is digitally
signed and contains a payload that can be verified and trusted.

Here's a breakdown of the JWT structure:

1. **Header**: Contains the algorithm used for signing the token, such as HMAC SHA256 or RS256.
2. **Payload** (also known as the "claims"): This is the data being transferred between parties. It can include information like user ID,
name, email, and other metadata.
3. **Signature**: A digital signature that verifies the token's authenticity.

The JWT token format is typically represented in this structure:
```
eyJhbGdvcml0aG0iOiJURSI6Iiwic2NvcGVzIjpbWyJ1c2ludCIyLDAsIM9vdCBleHBpcnkgcmVxdWlyZSBpcyBhIjoiMSIsICJleHAiOjE3MjM5NDU2fQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwstructure:```eyJhbGdvcml0aG0iOiJURSI6Iiwic2NvcGVzIjpbWyJ1c2ludCIyLDAsIM9vdCBleHBpcnkgcmVxdWlyZSBpcyBhIjoiMSIsICJleHAiOjE3MjM5NDU2fQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```
In this example, the header contains `eyJhbGdvcml0aG0iOiJURSI6Ii`, which indicates that the token was signed using a secret key. The
payload is `WyJ1c2ludCIyLDAsIM9vdCBleHBpcnkgcmVxdWlyZSBpcyBhIjoiMSIsICJleHAiOjE3MjM5NDU2fQ`, which contains the user's ID and other
metadata. The signature is `SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c`.

**How JWT works:**

1. A client (e.g., a web application) sends a request to a server.
2. The server verifies the user's identity by checking the JWT token in the request header.
3. If the token is valid, the server extracts the payload and uses it to authenticate the user.
4. The server can also use the payload to authorize access to certain resources or actions.

**Advantages of JWT:**

1. **Stateless**: JWT tokens are self-contained and don't require a database or server-side storage to verify the user's identity.
2. **Compact**: JWT tokens are small and lightweight, making them ideal for use in web applications.
3. **Secure**: JWT tokens are digitally signed and can be verified without revealing sensitive information.

**Common use cases:**

1. **Authentication**: JWT tokens are often used as a form of authentication in web applications.
2. **Authorization**: JWT tokens can be used to authorize access to certain resources or actions.
3. **Single sign-on (SSO)**: JWT tokens can be used to implement SSO across multiple applications.

**Common errors and pitfalls:**

1. **Token expiration**: JWT tokens have a limited lifespan, which must be considered when designing the application.
2. **Token revocation**: JWT tokens should be revoked or updated when the user's identity changes.
3. **Security risks**: JWT tokens can be vulnerable to attacks like token tampering or replay attacks.

Overall, JWT is a widely used and effective solution for authentication and authorization in web applications. However, it requires
careful consideration of security and implementation details to ensure its effectiveness and prevent common errors.
