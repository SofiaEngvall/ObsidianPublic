JWT stands for JSON Web Token, which is a compact and self-contained way of securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON
object. It is primarily used for authentication and authorization in web applications but can also be utilized for other purposes such as
information exchange.

Here's an overview of how JWT works:

### Structure

A JWT consists of three parts, each separated by a dot (`.`):

1. **Header**:
   - The header typically consists of two parts: the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "alg": "HS256",
       "typ": "JWT"
     }
     ```

2. **Payload**:
   - The payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
   - There are three types of claims:
     - Registered claims: These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, such as `iss` (issuer), `exp`
(expiration time), `sub` (subject), etc.
     - Public claims: Custom claims defined by the client or server to share information. They should be unique within an application and
prefixed with `com`, `app`, or a URI that's globally unique to avoid collisions.
     - Private claims: Custom claims used to share information between parties that agree on using them.

   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "sub": "1234567890",
       "name": "John Doe",
       "admin": true,
       "iat": 1516239022
     }
     ```

3. **Signature**:
   - The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the
way.
   - To create the signature part, you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header,
and sign that.

   - Example using HMAC SHA256:
     ```
     HMACSHA256(
       base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
       base64UrlEncode(payload),
       your-256-bit-secret
     )
     ```

### Usage

1. **Creation**:
   - The server creates a JWT when the user logs in by encoding the header and payload, and then signing it with a secret key or
public/private keys.

2. **Transmission**:
   - Once created, this token can be sent to the client. Typically, this is done via HTTP headers, such as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

3. **Verification**:
   - When the server receives the JWT from subsequent requests (e.g., API calls), it verifies the signature using the secret or public key
and checks the claims like expiration (`exp`) to ensure the token is valid.

4. **Decoding**:
   - On the client-side, you can decode a JWT (without verifying its signature) to read the payload.

### Advantages

- **Stateless**: Since JWTs contain all necessary information, they are stateless and do not require server-side storage for user sessions.
- **Scalability**: They allow applications to scale easily as session data does not need to be stored or synchronized across multiple
servers.
- **Cross-Domain Usage**: JWTs can be used in cross-domain scenarios like single sign-on (SSO) systems.

### Security Considerations

While JWTs are useful, they must be handled carefully:

- Always use HTTPS to prevent token interception.
- Use secure and strong signing keys.
- Set appropriate expiration times for tokens to limit their validity period.
- Consider additional security measures like token revocation or refresh tokens if needed.

By understanding the structure and usage of JWTs, you can effectively integrate them into your application for secure authentication and
authorization.
