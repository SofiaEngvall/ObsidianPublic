 JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. They are often used in web development for secure
authentication and information passing.

A JSON Web Token consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature.

1. Header: The header typically contains the type of token (e.g., JWT), the hashing algorithm used to sign the token (e.g., HMAC SHA256 or RSA) and any other metadata
needed for processing the token.

2. Payload: The payload contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (usually, a user). These claims may include information such as the user's ID, roles,
expiration time of the token, and more. Claim names must be registered in IETF JSON Web Token Registry or be publicly-defined but unregistered.

3. Signature: To create the signature part, a cryptographic function is applied to the combined header and payload, using a secret key. The result is then encoded as a
base64url string and added to the token as the third part. This ensures that the integrity of the token remains intact during transmission and that it was indeed
issued by the expected authority (authentication).

When a client makes a request to an application, the application will validate the JWT if it is included in the request. If the signature is valid, the claims within
the payload are used to determine the user's identity and the permissions they have for accessing resources. This process ensures secure access to protected resources
without having to send a username and password with every request (single sign-on).

JWTs are versatile, open standard tokens that can be easily implemented in many different environments and are well suited for stateless applications and APIs due to
their compact size and flexibility.
