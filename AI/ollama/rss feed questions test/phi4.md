Hi phi4! You run in ollama. I'd like to use you in my python project that reads rss feeds and gathers articles - I'd like you to summarize the
... long articles for me. this will all be run on the same computer                                                                              r
Integrating a language model like Phi into your Python project to read RSS feeds, gather articles, and summarize them is an exciting way to
automate content processing. Since you're running it locally with Ollama, here's a general approach on how you might set up such a system:

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

Ensure that your environment has all the necessary libraries installed. You'll need packages for handling RSS feeds and interacting with Phi.

```bash
pip install feedparser transformers torch ollama
```

- **feedparser**: For parsing RSS feeds.
- **transformers** and **torch**: To interact with language models like Phi via the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- **ollama**: Your local model runner, assuming it has a Python interface or API.

### 2. Fetch Articles from RSS Feeds

You can use `feedparser` to fetch articles from RSS feeds.

```python
import feedparser

def get_rss_feed_articles(feed_url):
    feed = feedparser.parse(feed_url)
    return [(entry.title, entry.link, entry.summary) for entry in feed.entries]

# Example usage:
feed_url = 'http://example.com/rss'
articles = get_rss_feed_articles(feed_url)

for title, link, summary in articles:
    print(f"Title: {title}\nLink: {link}\nSummary: {summary}\n")
```

### 3. Summarize Articles with Phi

You'll need to load your model and use it to summarize the content of the articles you fetch.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load your local model via Ollama
# This is a placeholder for however Ollama provides access to models
phi_model = ollama.load_model('phi4')  # Replace with actual method if different

def summarize_article(article_text):
    summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model=phi_model)
    summary = summarizer(article_text, max_length=150, min_length=40, do_sample=False)
    return summary[0]['summary_text']

# Example usage for fetched articles:
for title, link, _ in articles:
    # Assume get_full_article_content fetches the full content of an article
    full_text = get_full_article_content(link)  # You'd need to implement this function
    summarized_text = summarize_article(full_text)
    print(f"Title: {title}\nSummary: {summarized_text}\n")
```

### 4. Implement `get_full_article_content`

To fetch the full article content, you might use a library like `requests` or `BeautifulSoup`.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_full_article_content(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # This is highly dependent on the HTML structure of your articles
    article_text = soup.find('div', class_='article-content')  # Adjust as needed
    return article_text.text if article_text else ''

# Note: The CSS selector used in find() will need to be adjusted according to each site's layout.
```

### Additional Considerations

- **Ethical Use**: Ensure that you respect the terms of service and copyright laws regarding content aggregation and summarization.
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of not overloading websites when fetching full article contents.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: If needed, fine-tune Phi on a dataset relevant to your specific needs.

This should give you a basic framework. Adapt it as necessary based on the specifics of how Ollama integrates with Python and any additional
requirements for your project.

>>> this is how the ollama python library works: from ollama import chat\nfrom ollama import ChatResponse\n\nresponse: ChatResponse = chat(model='l
... lama3.2', messages=[\n  {\n    'role': 'user',\n    'content': 'Why is the sky blue?',\n  },\n])\nprint(response['message']['content'])\n# or a
... ccess fields directly from the response object\nprint(response.message.content)\n
Given the specifics of how the Ollama library works, you can integrate it into your project to summarize articles fetched from RSS feeds.
Here's a step-by-step guide on how you could set this up:

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

Ensure that you have all necessary libraries installed.

```bash
pip install feedparser requests beautifulsoup4 ollama
```

- **feedparser**: For parsing RSS feeds.
- **requests** and **beautifulsoup4**: To fetch and parse full article contents from URLs.
- **ollama**: To interact with your local language model.

### 2. Fetch Articles from RSS Feeds

Use `feedparser` to get articles from an RSS feed.

```python
import feedparser

def get_rss_feed_articles(feed_url):
    feed = feedparser.parse(feed_url)
    return [(entry.title, entry.link) for entry in feed.entries]

# Example usage:
feed_url = 'http://example.com/rss'
articles = get_rss_feed_articles(feed_url)

for title, link in articles:
    print(f"Title: {title}\nLink: {link}\n")
```

### 3. Fetch Full Article Content

Implement a function to fetch the full text of each article.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_full_article_content(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # Adjust the selector based on the website's structure
    article_text = soup.find('div', class_='article-content')  # Example: adjust as needed
    return article_text.text.strip() if article_text else ''

# Example usage:
for title, link in articles:
    full_text = get_full_article_content(link)
    print(f"Title: {title}\nFull Text: {full_text[:100]}...")  # Print a snippet for verification
```

### 4. Summarize Articles Using Ollama

Use the Ollama library to summarize each article.

```python
from ollama import chat, ChatResponse

def summarize_article(article_text):
    response = chat(
        model='llama3.2',
        messages=[
            {
                'role': 'user',
                'content': f"Summarize this article: {article_text}",
            }
        ]
    )
    return response.message.content

# Example usage for fetched articles:
for title, link in articles:
    full_text = get_full_article_content(link)
    summarized_text = summarize_article(full_text)
    print(f"Title: {title}\nSummary: {summarized_text}\n")
```

### Additional Considerations

- **Ethical Use**: Always respect the terms of service and copyright laws for each website.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement delays or limits to avoid overloading websites when fetching full articles.
- **Error Handling**: Add error handling for network requests and parsing to manage exceptions gracefully.

This setup should help you integrate Ollama into your Python project effectively, allowing you to summarize long articles fetched from RSS
feeds. Adjust selectors and model parameters as needed based on the specific content and requirements of your project.
