used deepseek to grade (chatgpt ran out)

Hi, I'm putting together a list of useful rss feeds.

Could you please check if the feeds on this list are considered good?

Please add a field at the end (1-10) for how good and useful they are where where 10 is the best.

Feel free to add more rss feeds to the end of the list. All rss feeds need to be in English.

It is a list of cyber security feeds, the aim is news feeds but other interesting ones are also on there

Thanks you but ss python needs to be able to read this I need the information in the same format I sent you. Just add an extra field to the end of every line, containing the digits 1 to 10 depending on how you grade them. Thanks!
