Attackers only need to find one problem - Defenders need to make sure everything is protected

**CIA**

Confidentiality
- Access Control
- Encryption

Integrity
- Prevention
- Detection

Availability
- Denial of Service

**Threats**

Disclosure - ex pin number seen over shoulder, keylogger...
Deception - ex spoofing, social engineering
Disruption - ex dos
Usurpation - ex 

All goes back to CIA

**Common Threats**

Snooping (wiretapping) 
Modification/alteration
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM)
Masquerading/spoofing
- Delegation? Like secretary sent with bosses email address
Repudiation
- (deniability) saying it wasn't them that did something
Denial of receipt
- sorry we didn't get  your order, though they got it
Delay
Denial of service

**How to Defend Against Threats**

Security policy, we should lock the door
Security mechanism, actually locking the door

**Security Policy Goals**

Prevention
Detection
Recovery

Base for plan, can go in a cycle/loop

policies can be defined by words/natural language, maths for precise descriptions (too precise?)

Correctness
Assumptions
-  is the lock good enough, but maybe the hinges are loose...
Trust
- Who do we trust?

Mechanisms
- Secure
- Precise
- Broad

Assurance
You can't guarantee anything  - The question is how confident you are
How to trust that the system is secure?
- How much to trust the system?
- Can this be quantified?
What does it depend on?

Start already at design stage
Then the implementation of the design
Then deployment, config...
