The Cyber Defense path aims to give a broad introduction to the different areas necessary to detect and respond to threats. This path will be looking at the following areas:

- Getting Started
- Threat and Vulnerability Management
- Security Operations and Monitoring
- Threat Emulation
- Incident Response & Forensics
- Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering

Once you complete this path, you should have the fundamental components of detecting and responding to threats in a corporate environment andÂ using these core concepts to build your understanding of more complex topics within this field.

**Note**: This pathway is still under development and more rooms will be added as they become available.
