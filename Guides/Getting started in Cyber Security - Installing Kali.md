### Installing Kali Linux

Download a Kali image from https://www.kali.org/get-kali

I would recommend using the network installation image.

If you want a full installation containing all the available tools you can download the "Everything" image but you can also easily upgrade to this version later.

### Upgrading Kali to the Everything version

1. make sure your Kali installation in fully uptaded by running `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt full-upgrade`
2. run `sudo apt install kali-linux-everything`


### Installing Kali on a virtual machine

If you're installing Kali as a virtual machine - Install the VM tools for the platform that you're using!
