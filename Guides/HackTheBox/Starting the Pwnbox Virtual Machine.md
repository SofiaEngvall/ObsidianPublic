## Using the Pwnbox

Clicking Open Desktop will open the Virtual Machine (VM) in a separate browser tab

(You can full screen the VM by opening another tab, pressing F11 to full screen it, and then switching back to the VM tab. This as the F11 is caught by the VM on that tab.)

The Pwnbox runs Parrot which is a Linux version.

### Where to find programs

If you click the icon in the upper left corner, you see the menu.

Quite a few programs are preinstalled:
![[Images/Pasted image 20250616142044.png]]

To open the terminal/command line, click the green square 
![[Images/Pasted image 20250616142307.png]]
(more about Bash here: [[Linux terminal (command line) basics]])

In the easy access program bar we see:
- Firefox - internet browser
- Pluma - text editor
- Code - code editor
- Burp - internet proxy and more!
- Wireshark - network traffic, packet analysis
- Bash - bash terminal
- Powershell - powershell terminal

The Pentesting tools are also available in the Windows-style menu in the lower left corner
![[Images/Pasted image 20250616143014.png]]
Here, they are not categorized but just in alphabetical order

### Copy and Paste

Click the little clipboard in the lower right corner
![[Images/Pasted image 20250616143641.png]]

The Clipboard will pop up
![[Images/Pasted image 20250616143726.png]]

When you use Ctrl+C in the VM, to copy something, it will show up here.

You can paste things from your computer and paste here, and then paste in the VM.

This is a necessary workaround since the VM is running in the browser.
