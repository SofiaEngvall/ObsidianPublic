The report is what you get payed for
It's used as a base for the company to make decisions

Why is something bad - The context and the possible repercussions need to be clear

Don't try to impress other hackers + Don't be arrogant, be kind
But: You're the expert - You were hired - They want to hear your opinion

Positive and negative findings have the same value - Tell but the good and the bad - The vulnerabilities and the working protections
Report as you go, don't just take notes - Write a story

Two separate groups - tech people and business people - Write so the non tech people can follow
Write the exec summary last - Focus on what can be fixed

Show tech people what commands you ran and when, so they can repeat the process and so they can check the logs.
Show business people summarize without tech terms, point out where detections could have been made

Do's and don't's
Inform the reader - facts, where, files, impact which is expert opinion - claim evdence * mult, discussion (expert opinion)
anonymize report? - your data? no, show your mac so they can find it in logs
Don't insult the reader - even by mistake - no why does this use this unsecure thingy, just tell the facts, what happened
Disorient the reader - make someone proof read - have an intro/overwiew, explain all examples
Help the reader understand - so they can base decisions on it
Screenshots - to illustrate (not decorate) your story - helpful, relevant, accurare and clear, legible, directs attention, no stuff we don't need - caption
Consistent formatting - red siege report template good, headers
Never copy from old report - Never paste tool output without meaningful analysis
