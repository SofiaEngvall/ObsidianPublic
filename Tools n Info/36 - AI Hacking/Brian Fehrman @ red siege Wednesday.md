system prompt + your message in blob and sends to model - the model can't really know which is which

using chars that might be used in the system prompt

"ignore all previous commands"

plany - youtube n discord


guard rails

tricks:
encoding
leet speak

mitigations:
prompt rewriting - a model extra for parsing the input, trying to get the semantic meaning
ai trained on attacks in between too, a judge model - score on bad vs good - if it's good it's sent on
security layers

also checking the output - does it contain sensitive data, like soc sec no, card no
bypass, encode..
give answer but every other word add a prime number too it
