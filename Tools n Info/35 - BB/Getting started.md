### Submitting

- Write so a developer can understand, not just a security researcher
- Think from the customers angle
	- What can you actually do with this bug?
	- How hard will it be to fix?
- Select the right category - Go for top level if you can't find a suitable one
- Use Markdown to make it easy to read
- Include as much information as possible
- Good screenshots
- Videos are great as is also proves the bug was there in case it's fixed later

Make templates for common bug reports


### Note taking
(Haddix uses Xmind mindmap)
(Color code the status of parts of notes, ex green = done, orange = working on this)
Keep track on where you are, so you can come back later

What he said:
multiple user roles?
how does it reference users
how does it handle special characters
what are the dynamic parameters
does it have an api component
what kind of errors am I seeing
does it have file uploads
have I done javascript analysis for path
have I done content discovery


### Recon

Wide Recon - find as many assets related to the target as possible (make sure they are within scope)

Scope domains
- From bb site
- wide scope = `*.tesla.com`, "Any host verified to be owned by Tesla..."
	examples, tesla.com, verizon media
Acqusitions
	- is there stuff that has not been taken down
	- search site: Chrunchbase
ASN Enumeration (Autonomous System Number)
- given to big networks - shows known ip ranges
- search site: hurricane electric (https://bap.he.net)
- cmd tools: mstebigor, asnlookup
Reverse WHOIS
Subdomain Enumeration
Port Analysis

Vulnerability scanning (during recon)
- Subdomain Takeover
- Buckets
- Github leaks

Automation/Helpers
- Interlace
- - Screenshotting
- Frameworks
