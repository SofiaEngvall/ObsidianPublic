: For the past few weeks, I was building my own labs/boxes for interns, It's also a good practice for Offsec's UGC. Till now I've made 2 AD Labs and 3 Individual Linux targets

: You can share no problem

aibel_443
: if you are planning to do, and if its in vmware For DC01 and MS02 add a host only adapter in vmware which is seperate from the nat adapter, so it has pivoting

aibel_443
: and about the setup Like if your kali is on NAT and it has 192.168.50.0/24, MS01 has 192.168.50.0/24 (NAT) and Host only which can be on 172.16.11.0/24 and uncheck the option of connect a host adapter on this while creating the additional network and MS02 and DC01 will be on Host only adapter i.e 172.16.11.0/24 no NAT Adapter
