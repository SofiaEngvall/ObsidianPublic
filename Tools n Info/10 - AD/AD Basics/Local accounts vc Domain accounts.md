## Administrators and UAC

While performing most of the lateral movement techniques introduced throughout the room, we will mainly use administrator credentials. While one might expect that every single administrator account would serve the same purpose, a distinction has to be made between two types of administrators:

- Local accounts part of the local Administrators group
- Domain accounts part of the local Administrators group

The differences we are interested in are restrictions imposed by **User Account Control (UAC)** over local administrators (except for the default Administrator account). By default, local administrators won't be able to remotely connect to a machine and perform administrative tasks unless using an interactive session through RDP. Windows will deny any administrative task requested via RPC, SMB or WinRM since such administrators will be logged in with a filtered medium integrity token, preventing the account from doing privileged actions. The only local account that will get full privileges is the default Administrator account.

Domain accounts with local administration privileges won't be subject to the same treatment and will be logged in with full administrative privileges.

This security feature can be disabled if desired, and sometimes you will find no difference between local and domain accounts in the administrator's group. Still, it's essential to keep in mind that should some of the lateral movement techniques fail, it might be due to using a non-default local administrator where UAC is enforced.
