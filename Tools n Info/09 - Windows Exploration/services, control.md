### Info

`net` can only start, stop and pause services.
`sc` has more advanced controls, can query state, create and delete services, change their configuration and security: `sc config beep start= demand`

`net` only works locally.
`sc` can be used over the network: `sc \\snow start rpcapd`

`net` accepts display names: `net start "Windows Firewall"`
`sc` always requires a service name: `sc start SharedAccess`

`net` stop and start are blocking, `sc` stop and start are not
meaning we can't get an accurate reply from sc if it was successful

    ri=      The resume index number at which to begin the enumeration
             (default = 0)
