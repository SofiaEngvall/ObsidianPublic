Port **5985** is the default port for **WinRM (Windows Remote Management Service)**, which uses the **WS-Management protocol**, a SOAP-based protocol over HTTP.

On the backend it's utilising WMI, so you can think of it as an HTTP based API for WMI.

If WinRM is not configured for remote access, but the service is started, it listens for local requests on TCP port 47001. If you create listener it will still listen on 47001, but also on the default TCP ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS).

All users of the groups `BUILTIN\Administrators` and `BUILTIN\Remote Management Users` are allowed to connect by default.

Test to send (with nc for example):
```http
POST /wsman HTTP/1.1
Host: <target-ip>
User-Agent: curl/7.55.1
Content-Type: application/soap+xml;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 0

```

### Connect

To connect, we can use:
- `evil-winrm` [[Evil-WinRM]]
- `pywinrm` (Python library)
- PowerShell's `Invoke-Command` or `Enter-PSSession`
