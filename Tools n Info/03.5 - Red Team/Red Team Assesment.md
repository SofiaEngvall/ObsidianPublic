private subnet, no other way to C2 server than to the redirector - we burn the redirect, not the c2

### Stating the assessment

Responder - pretends to be several services
multicast name resolution - LLMNR, NPT-NS - request; where's machine x, responder: that's me!
- we get windows hashes - to crack or relay

mornings or after lunch is the best time
