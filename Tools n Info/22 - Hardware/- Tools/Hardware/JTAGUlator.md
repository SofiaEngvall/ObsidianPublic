Assists in identifying OCD interfaces from test points, vias, component pads, or connectors of a target device.

"On-chip debug (OCD) interfaces can provide chip-level control of a target device and are a primary vector used by engineers, researchers, and hackers to extract program code or data, modify memory contents, or affect device operation on-the-fly. Depending on the complexity of the target device, manually locating available OCD interfaces can be a difficult and time consuming task, sometimes requiring physical destruction or modification of the device."
