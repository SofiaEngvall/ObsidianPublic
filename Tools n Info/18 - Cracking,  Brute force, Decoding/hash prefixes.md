`$1$`  MD5
`$2$` or `$2a$` Blowfish
`$5$`  SHA-256
`$6$`  SHA-512

listed in the order of decreasing strength:
`$y$` 	yescrypt is a scalable hashing scheme and is the default and recommended choice in new systems
`$gy$` 	gost-yescrypt uses the GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function and the yescrypt hashing method
`$7$` 	scrypt is a password-based key derivation function
`$2b$`, `$2y$`, `$2a$`, `$2x$` 	bcrypt is a hash based on the Blowfish block cipher originally developed for OpenBSD but supported on a recent version of FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris 10 and newer, and several Linux distributions
`$6$` 	sha512crypt is a hash based on SHA-2 with 512-bit output originally developed for GNU libc and commonly used on (older) Linux systems
`$md5` 	SunMD5 is a hash based on the MD5 algorithm originally developed for Solaris
`$1$` 	md5crypt is a hash based on the MD5 algorithm originally developed for FreeBSD
